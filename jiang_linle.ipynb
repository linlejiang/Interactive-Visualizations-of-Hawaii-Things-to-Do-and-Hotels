    "\n",
    "    Consistent with my Milestone 1 assignment, my motivation to select this project is to plan a trip to Hawaii. From my experience, there isn’t any interactive maps with both top sights and hotels plotted simultaneously or without substantial manual efforts. Therefore, the ultimate goals of this project are: 1) to create three interactive maps of Hawaii automatically, which will enable users to interact with the maps (e.g., the size of maps can be changed within the visualization, and when the mouse cursor is at a hotel datapoint, the name of the hotel will show up); and 2) to compare visually how different the distributions would be for hotels plotted by different popularity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, there are some minor changes: \n",
    "\n",
    "      1. the hotel address data was planned to be scraped from TripAdvisor initially, in order to use Google API to get geometry results. However, this plan was dropped due to the following reasons:     \n",
    "          1) some hotel addresses obtained from TripAdvisor were not correct, after check the website;  \n",
    "          2) Google API allows for hotel names as inputs to request hotel geometry, and using this approach substantially decrease the number of missing data than scraping from TripAdvisor;          \n",
    "          3) this increases the data acquiring time significantly, and lower the probability of being banned by the website, as the number of requests drop substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. I plot 20 sights instead of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "      3. Instead of collecting all hotel listings from TripAdvisor, I specified certain criteria to determine what kinds of hotels should be included in this dataset. This is to resemble real-life hotel selection processes, and to limit the number of request queries when the code scrapes data from TripAdvisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "      4. The three metrics used to describe the hotels are price, popularity (i.e., number of reviews), and recommendation (i.e., computed by the product of the ratings and the standardized number of reviews). The recommendation metric is also used to select the sights in the plot."

    "6. **What did you Discover/what were your conclusions (i.e. what were your findings?  Were your original assumptions confirmed, etc.?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    I generate three interative plots in a html file, if you run the code, they will automatically show up in your browser. The plot enables users to interact with the maps (1. the size of maps can be changed; 2. when the mouse cursor is at a sight, the name of the sight will show up; 3. when the mouse cursor is at a hotel, the name and lowest price of the hotel will show up; 4. when click on the hotel circle, the browser will open a new tab directing the user to the hotel webpage in TripAdvisor; 5. the map can zoom in/out if you launch the wheelZoom tool; 6. you can drag the map to view different areas within the map).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Overall, in this project, I found that the most recommended sights (i.e., the metric based on reviews and ratings) are concentrated in the urban area, only a few of them are natural sights. Also, although all the islands have at least one most recommended sight, most of them are in Honolulu. This makes sense, considering that Honolulu is the most developed area in Hawaii islands. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For the hotels included in the dataset, first, most of them are located near the sea. This is consistent with the idea that the general public enjoys the beach and hotels with a view of the sea. Additionally, it appears that the cheaper hotels tend to cluster together, likely due to the high demand and competitive nature, while the more expensive hotels are more spread out. Also, only about half of the sights have hotels closeby, this is especially the case in the Island of Hawaii and the urban area of Honolulu. Moreover, these hotels closer to the sights tend to have lower prices. Finally, it appears that there are positive correlations between hotel price, popularity (i.e., number of reviews), and recommendation. Consider the higher expenses in Hawaii, it is possible that visitors of Hawaii tend to have higher income level. And thus they also tend to stay at hotels with higher quality, and are able to afford such expenses."

    "    The most difficult part for me is to scrape a large amount of data from TripAdvisor. According to my initial plan, I would have to make thousands of request to the website in order to get all the hotel data. To avoid being banned by the website, I tried to rotate proxies and user agents. However, that was not practical because the free public IP significantly slowed down the scraping processes, which is likely due to the extended time making requests via different proxies. Therefore, I had to step back and figure out what were the data that might not be necessary. Fortunately, I was able to increase the number of hotels to be included in this dataset by removing one unecessary attribute (i.e., hotel address, note that each address needs one individual request when scraping).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Another difficulty I had was to optimize my code to shorten the time spent on scraping the hotel data. However, my hand is tied given the website structure, which requires a large amount of requests to be made."

I did learn some techniques and applied, but they weren't successful attempts. Third, I wished I had known how to create interative visualizations, which, through this project, I learned about how to use the bokeh package to create interactive maps. I was able to include all features as planned. Still, there are a lot more useful and interesting features to be learned. Finally, I wished I had learned some NLP techniques, so that I could collect the reviews for each hotel, and extract keywords from the review to provide some qualitative descriptions for the each hotel.
